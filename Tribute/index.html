            <p>Vivekananda (Shami BibekƒÅnondo) (January 12, 1863-July 4, 1902) was the chief disciple of Shri
                Ramakrishna Paramahansa. At birth, he was called Narendranath Datta. He was
                the founder of Ramakrishna Mission. He introduced Hindu philosophy of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and
                America. He brought Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of the 19th century.
                Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age
                towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and
                became a monk. After the
                death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand
                knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he
                resolved to help his countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a
                popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, in which he began his famous speech
                with the words: Sisters and brothers of America... before introducing Hinduism to Americans.[11][12] He
                was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine
                right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament"
